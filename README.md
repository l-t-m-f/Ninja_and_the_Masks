# Ninja and the Masks

Ninja and the Masks... WOW, I love that one. It's the first game I ever made using Construct 3.
It was meant to be a sort of tribute to Stick RPG type games. An web-browser RPG about a small unusual world.

The world is quite fleshed out. Some of the systems are buggy or unfinished, but I'm sure you
can appreciate the effort.
